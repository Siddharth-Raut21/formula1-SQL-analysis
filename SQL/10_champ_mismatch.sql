-- Problem 10: Find seasons where the championship-winning driver was not from the championship-winning constructor.
/* Explanation: The driver champion is the driver in driver_standings with position = 1 at the final race of the season.
				The constructor champion is the constructor in constructor_standings with position = 1 at the final race of the season.
				So, For each season:
				- Find the driver champion â†’ his/her constructorId.
				- Find the constructor champion.
                So, for this we use CTE
                
                At first, we oconstructorStandingsIdnly fond the final races
                Then we find the championship-winning driver using races, results, drivers, driver_standings tables.
                Apply the condition as position = 1.
                
                After this, we find the championship-winning constructor using races, constructors, constructor_standings tables.
                Apply the condition as position = 1.
                
                At last compare the both campions (driver & constructor champion) using the following condition:
                where d.driver_constructorId <> cc.constructorId
