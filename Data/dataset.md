#### It is the most comprehensive choice for practicing SQL skills.

### The reasons for choosing this dataset are as follows.
----------------------------------------------------------

#### 1. SQL Fundamentals: SELECT, DISTINCT, WHERE, operators for basic data extraction and filtering.
#### 2. Aggregations & GROUP BY: SUM, COUNT, AVG, MAX, MIN.
#### 3. Joins (All Types): Complex relationships between drivers, teams, races, circuits, and results require extensive JOIN practice.
#### 4. Aggregations & GROUP BY: Perfect for calculating championship points, race statistics, driver performance metrics, and team comparisons.
#### 5. Window Functions: Ideal for ranking drivers, calculating running totals of points, and comparing performance across seasons.
#### 6. Subqueries: Excellent for complex comparisons like "drivers faster than average lap time" or "teams with more wins than median".
#### 7. CTEs: Large dataset supports breaking down complex analysis into manageable steps.
#### 8. CASE-END Logic: Categorizing drivers by performance, race outcomes, or era-based analysis.
#### 9. Date/Time Analysis: Rich temporal data for season-over-season analysis and career progression tracking.
#### 10. ORDER BY & HAVING: Sorting and filtering after aggregation for tasks such as ranking.
